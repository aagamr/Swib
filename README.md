# Swib
Swib Com is a platform for developers and indie makers to share projects, MVPs, and toolsâ€”like a mini Product Hunt. It helps creators showcase work, get feedback, and gain early users, even without big marketing. A space where small ideas get big visibility.
I collaborated with Yogesh Vashisht on this project as a full-stack developer, focusing on making the application more scalable and highly efficient.
